## Development scripts

This directory contains useful scripts for Freshmaker development.

It is hard to test Freshmaker end to end locally, because it depends
on lot of other services. To be able to test some parts locally,
we use few scripts stored in this directory.

The scripts with "template_" prefix are just templates creating instances
of particular Freshmaker classes so they can later be used for testing.
